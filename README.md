# World_Visualization
The aim is to expand the WorldVis visualization by allowing for any type of world data.We also aim to add functionality by increasing the number of complementary visualizations. For
instance, adding the ability to compare the data for multiple selected countries or by adding new charts when a user clicks on a particular country. We are focusing only on the visual
encoding and interaction idiom level of vis design since the domain and data are based on the input.
